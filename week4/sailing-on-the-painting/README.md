#### Description:
   Inspired by traditional Chinese paintings, this  project attempts to create an interactive version of painting using p5.js. Besides following a certain art style, this project also adds several interactive elements to the painting which allow users to  take part in it including simulating the movement of petals, music effects and changes of the painting itself called by certain behaviors. In a sense, this project aims to share the aesthetic understanding of the author by offering interactive experience.

#### Instructions for Using:
   There are four interactive elements on the canvas currently:

   1. Click on the sun, the whole painting will get dark.
      Click on it again, the painting will get back to norm.
   
   2. Click on the tree, the sound of the shaking tree will begin to play, and the color of the falling petals will change accordingly.
      The painting will get back to norm once the sound ends.
   
   3. Click on the birds, the sound of birds will begin to play.
      The painting will get back to norm once the sound ends.

   4. Click on the boat, a clip of melody will begin to play, and the boat will begin moving on the painting.
      The painting will get back to norm once the melody ends.
